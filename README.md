## ðŸ“š SecSci-Burp-Extensions

**SecSci-Burp-Extensions** is a curated collection of custom-built **BurpSuite extensions** developed by the Security-Science. These extensions are designed to enhance and automate various phases of **penetration testing**, focusing on efficiency, repeatability, and advanced reporting.

Much like **[Sec-Sci AutoPT](https://www.security-science.com/sec-sci-autopt)** â€” an automated penetration testing framework â€” this project aims to integrate seamlessly into modern offensive security workflows.


## Key Features:

- **Modular Burp Extensions**: Each extension is self-contained and purpose-driven.
- **Automation-Ready**: Tailored for security automation tools and CI/CD pipelines.
- **Reporting Tools**: Extensions like `xBurp-xReport` provide fast, customizable vulnerability reports to be exported into `HTML` or `XML` format.
- **Vulnerability Scanners**: Including specialized scanners for SQLi, SSL/TLS misconfigurations, weak ciphers, and more.
- **Built with Intelligence**: Designed to work with enhanced analysis and red teaming frameworks.
